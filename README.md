One Click Site Opener
=====================

opens your favorite websites in one click.

A while back, I create a one click site opener for Windows user, accessible here: http://dreams-soft.com/products/one-click-site-opener.
This script does the same job. Since it uses python, Linux and Mac users will find it helpful.

Edit the websites.txt and enter your faorite websites. The first line is the delay in seconds, so 3 means a delay of 3 seconds in successive websites. If you want no delay, write 0.
